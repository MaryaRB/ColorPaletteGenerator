# ColorPaletteGenerator
This is the capstone project of MISK Data Science Immersive course. It is a program that will generate a color palette for the user depending on colors data and color theory, the user input will be in the format of a single word. I'll keep updating this repo with my progress till the project is fully implemented. 

### Current status of the project
I'm currently working on exploring the possible data sets that I can use, I have 3 options to choose from:
  1- Palette-and-Text (PAT) dataset collected for the [Text2Color](https://github.com/awesome-davian/Text2Colors) peoject.
  2- Improving the [color terms dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/color-terms-dataset) by scrapping more lables from text and article that descripe colors in words.
  3- Using Image processing to obtain colors from images that is related to the used word, for this I think of using [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).
I want to test each approach, I'll update the repo with my expiriments and desicion before moving to the next step.
